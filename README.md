# YouTube Download Tool (Using pytube)

## ⚠️ Important Notice ⚠️

This project used the Python package `pytube` to download videos and audio from YouTube. Unfortunately, as of now, **pytube is no longer being maintained by its developer**. Additionally, **YouTube has made changes on their platform** that have rendered `pytube` non-functional for most use cases.

### Current Status
- **This project no longer works** due to the above reasons.
- If you attempt to use this tool, you are likely to encounter errors caused by incompatibilities between `pytube` and YouTube's updated systems.

### Recommended Alternative
For a modern and actively maintained solution, I recommend switching to [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp). `yt-dlp` is a fork of the popular `youtube-dl` and is frequently updated to keep up with changes on YouTube and other platforms.

### Good luck! ###
